# mcfrm-classification
Tools to 'classify' MC-FRM raster data and produce polygon feature classes from the classification.

This repository contains scripts to 'classify' the cells in 2050 MC-FRM probability rasters and generate polygon features from this classification.
These scripts layer are not parameterized. That is to say, the input and output FileGeodatabases are not curently parameterized;
this can be done when time is available. 
The intention here was to get work on these tools in its current - if not final - state put under version control sooner rather than later.

Inventory:
* classification_october_2022.py - Script implementing classification proposed by Judy Tayor on October 14, 2022.
